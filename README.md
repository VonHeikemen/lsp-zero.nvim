# LSP Zero

Collection of functions that will help you setup Neovim's LSP client, so you can get IDE-like features with minimum effort.

Out of the box it will help you integrate [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) (an autocompletion plugin) and [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) (a collection of configurations for various language servers). So a minimal config can look like this.

```lua
require('lsp-zero')
require('lspconfig').intelephense.setup({})
-- install and basic usage demo: https://asciinema.org/a/648850
```

With this code when `intelephense` (a language server) is active you'll get all the features Neovim offers by default plus autocompletion. [See demo in asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/648850).

## How to get started

If you are new to Neovim and you don't have a configuration file (`init.lua`) follow this [step by step tutorial](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/tutorial.html).

If you know how to configure Neovim go to the [Getting started](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/getting-started.html) page in the documentation.

## If you need any help

Feel free to open a new [discussion](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/discussions) in this repository. Or join the chat [#lsp-zero-nvim:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#lsp-zero-nvim:matrix.org).

If you have problems with a language server read this guide: [What to do when the language server doesn't start?](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/guide/what-to-do-when-lsp-doesnt-start.html)

If you want to migrate from a previous version to the `v3.x` branch, follow one of these guides:

* [Migrate from v2.x to v3.x](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/guide/migrate-from-v2-branch.html)
* [Migrate from v1.x to v3.x](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/guide/migrate-from-v1-branch.html)

## Quickstart (for the impatient)

If you are not that impatient, I recommend reading the [Getting started](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/getting-started.html) page.

But for those of you that just want to copy/paste, here are some templates you can use.

* [Lua template configuration](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/template/lua-config.html)
* [Vimscript template configuration](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/template/vimscript-config.html)
* [ThePrimeagen's "0 to LSP" config adapted to version 3](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/blog/theprimeagens-config-from-2022.html)
