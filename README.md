## Project status

Dead.

It took about 3 years but finally Neovim has solved all the issues that led to the creation of this plugin. Neovim v0.11 can provide [everything you need without installing extra plugins](https://vonheikemen.github.io/learn-nvim/feature/lsp-setup.html).

For those of you that still use Neovim v0.9 or v0.10, this blog post will show you a simple setup you can use as your base: [Getting started with Neovim's LSP client](https://dev.to/vonheikemen/getting-started-with-neovims-native-lsp-client-in-the-year-of-2022-the-easy-way-bp3).
