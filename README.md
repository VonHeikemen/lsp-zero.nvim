## Project status

Dead.

It took about 3 years but finally Neovim has solved all the issues that led to the creation of this plugin. Neovim v0.11 can provide [everything you need without installing extra plugins](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/blog/lsp-config-overview.html).

For those of you that still use Neovim v0.9 or v0.10, the [documentation site](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/docs/getting-started.html) will teach you about Neovim's LSP client and the plugins that were popular between 2022 and 2024. Do note that the ecosystem is changing and I have no interest in keeping that up to date with the new trends.
