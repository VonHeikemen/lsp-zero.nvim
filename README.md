# LSP Zero

Collection of functions that will help you use Neovim's LSP client. The aim is to provide abstractions on top of Neovim's LSP client that are easy to use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `v4.x` became the default branch on `August 03`. If you are here because of a youtube video or some other tutorial, pay attention to the version of lsp-zero its been used in that tutorial.

## Demo

Most people use lsp-zero just to help them setup [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) (an autocompletion plugin) and [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) (a plugin with pre-made configurations for various language servers). Here's a showcase of (some) features you can get using all those plugins.

> See [demo in asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/636643)
