*lsp-zero.txt*

A starting point to setup some lsp related features in neovim.

==============================================================================
Introduction                                                  *lsp-zero-intro*

The purpose of this plugin is to bundle all the "boilerplate code" needed
to have |nvim-cmp| (a popular autocompletion plugin) and the |LSP| client
working together. Additionally, with the help of |mason.nvim|,
it can let you install language servers from inside neovim.

==============================================================================
Quickstart                                               *lsp-zero-quickstart*

The fastest way to get started is by using a "preset" and immediately call
the |lsp-zero.setup()| function.
>lua
  local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset({})

  lsp.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
    lsp.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
  end)

  lsp.setup()
<
With this configuration lsp-zero will create keymaps to take advantage of some
features like jump to definition, rename variables, etc. It will also setup
the autocompletion plugin with a few "data sources" and keybindings.

                                                       *lsp-zero-api-showcase*

Here's a more advanced configuration showing the functions you have available
to configure and install LSP servers.
>lua
  local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset({})

  -- the function below will be executed whenever
  -- a language server is attached to a buffer
  lsp.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
    lsp.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
  end)

  -- make sure this servers are installed
  -- see :help lsp-zero.ensure_installed()
  lsp.ensure_installed({
    'rust_analyzer',
    'tsserver',
    'eslint',
  })

  -- pass arguments to a language server
  -- using lspconfig, see :help lspconfig-setup
  require('lspconfig').tsserver.setup({
    on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
      print('hello tsserver')
    end,
    settings = {
      completions = {
        completeFunctionCalls = true
      }
    }
  })

  -- configure lua language server for neovim
  require('lspconfig').lua_ls.setup(lsp.nvim_lua_ls())

  -- if you have a language that can't be
  -- installed with mason.nvim list it here
  lsp.setup_servers({'dartls'})

  -- don't initialize this language server
  -- we will use rust-tools to setup rust_analyzer
  lsp.skip_server_setup({'rust_analyzer'})

  lsp.setup()

  -- initialize rust_analyzer with rust-tools
  require('rust-tools').setup({})
<
==============================================================================
Presets                                                     *lsp-zero-presets*

Presets are a combinations of options that determine how |lsp-zero.setup()|
will behave, they can enable or disable features.

They are created when you use the function |lsp-zero.preset()|.
>lua
  local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset('minimal')
<
If you wish to override a setting from a preset use a lua table.
>lua
  local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset({
    name = 'minimal',
    set_lsp_keymaps = true,
    manage_nvim_cmp = true,
    suggest_lsp_servers = false,
  })
<
These are the available presets.

    * minimal
    * recommended
    * lsp-only
    * manual-setup
    * system-lsp

If you don't specify a preset then `minimal` will be the default.

                                                    *lsp-zero-preset-settings*

set_lsp_keymaps: ~
    It can be a boolean or a lua table.

    Supported properties:

    * preserve_mappings: ~
        Boolean, When set to true lsp-zero will not override any shortcut 
        that is already "taken". When set to false lsp-zero will create LSP
        shortcuts no matter what.

    * omit: ~
        List of strings. List of shorcuts you don't want lsp-zero to override.

    When set_lsp_keymaps is set to `true` then `preserve_mappings` is assumed
    to be false and omit is set to an empty list. When set_lsp_keymaps is
    `false` then the keybindings will not be created.

manage_nvim_cmp: ~
    It can be a boolean or a lua table. When is set to a boolean every
    supported property will have that value.

    Supported properties:

    * set_basic_mappings: ~
        Boolean. When set to `true` it will create keybindings that emulate
        Neovim's default completion.

    * set_extra_mappings: ~
        Boolean. When set to `true` it will setup tab completion, scrolling
        through documentation window, and navigation between snippets.

    * set_sources: ~
        String or Boolean. When set to 'lsp' it will only setup cmp-nvim-lsp
        as a source. When set to 'recommended' it will try to setup a few
        recommended sources for |nvim-cmp|. When set to the Boolean false it
        won't setup any sources.

    * use_luasnip: ~
        Boolean. When set to true it will setup luasnip to expand snippets.
        This option does not include a collection of snippets.

    * set_format: ~
        Boolean. When set to `true` it modify the format of the
        completion items.

    * documentation_window: ~
        Boolean. When set to `true` enables the documentation window.

setup_servers_on_start: ~
    Boolean. When set to `true` all servers installed with mason.nvim will be
    initialized on startup. If the value is false servers will be initialized
    when you call |lsp-zero.configure()| or |lsp-zero.setup_servers()|.

call_servers: ~
    String. When set to `'local'` it will use |mason.nvim| whenever possible.
    When set to `'global'` any feature or support that dependes on mason.nvim
    will be disabled.

configure_diagnostics: ~
    Boolean. When set to `true` adds borders to diagnostic floating window
    and sorts the messages according to the "severity".

float_border: ~
    String. Shape of borders in floating windows. It can be one of the
    following: `'none'`, `'single'`, `'double'`, `'rounded'`, `'solid'`
    or `'shadow'`.

                                                   *lsp-zero-available-preset*

minimal: ~
    Enables the support for mason.nvim if it is installed. Configures the
    diagnostics. Adds a basic setup to nvim-cmp. It doesn't add keybindings
    for LSP or autocompletion. Doesn't setup the sources for |nvim-cmp|.

    These are the settings it uses.
>lua
    {
      float_border = 'rounded',
      call_servers = 'local',
      configure_diagnostics = true,
      setup_servers_on_start = true,
      set_lsp_keymaps = false,
      manage_nvim_cmp = {
        set_sources = 'lsp',
        set_basic_mappings = true,
        set_extra_mappings = false,
        use_luasnip = true,
        set_format = true,
        documentation_window = false,
      },
    }
<
recommended: ~
    Creates keybindings bound to LSP actions. Configures diagnostics.
    Adds a complete configuration to nvim-cmp. And enables support
    for |mason.nvim|.

    These are the settings it uses.
>lua
    {
      float_border = 'rounded',
      call_servers = 'local',
      configure_diagnostics = true,
      setup_servers_on_start = true,
      set_lsp_keymaps = {
        preserve_mappings = false,
        omit = {},
      },
      manage_nvim_cmp = {
        set_sources = 'recommended',
        set_basic_mappings = true,
        set_extra_mappings = false,
        use_luasnip = true,
        set_format = true,
        documentation_window = true,
      },
    }
<
lsp-only: ~
    Is base on `recommended` preset but it disables the support for |nvim-cmp|.

manual-setup: ~
    Is based on `recommended` but it disables the automatic setup
    of language servers.

system-lsp: ~
    Is based on recommended but it disables all the features that depends
    on |mason.nvim|.

==============================================================================
Autocomplete                                           *lsp-zero-autocomplete*

The plugin responsible for autocompletion is |nvim-cmp|. This plugin
is designed to be unopinionated and modular. What this means for us (the users)
is that we have to assemble various pieces to get a good experience.

                                            *lsp-zero-recommended-cmp-sources*

|nvim-cmp| has a concept of "sources", these provide the actual data
displayed in neovim. If you set `manage_nvim_cmp.set_sources` to the
string `'recommended'` lsp-zero will try to setup the following sources
if they are installed:

    cmp-buffer: ~
        Provides suggestions based on the current file.
        Url: https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-buffer

    cmp-path: ~
        Gives completions based on the filesystem.
        Url: https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-path

    cmp_luasnip: ~
        It shows snippets in the suggestions.
        Url: https://github.com/saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip

    cmp-nvim-lsp: ~
        Show data send by the language server.
        Url: https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp

    cmp-nvim-lua: ~
        Provides completions based on neovim's lua api.
        Url: https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lua

                                             *lsp-zero-completion-keybindings*

When you enable `manage_nvim_cmp.set_basic_mappings` lsp-zero creates
the following keybindings.

    <Ctrl-y>: ~
        Confirms selection.

    <Ctrl-e>: ~
        Cancel completion.

    <Up>: ~
        Navigate to previous item on the list.

    <Down>: ~
        Navigate to the next item on the list.

    <Ctrl-p>: ~
        If the completion menu is visible, go to the previous item.
        Else, trigger completion menu.

    <Ctrl-n>: ~
        If the completion menu is visible, go to the next item.
        Else, trigger completion menu.

    <Ctrl-u>: ~
        Scroll up in the item's documentation.

    <Ctrl-d>: ~
        Scroll down in the item's documentation.

And when you enable `manage_nvim_cmp.set_extra_mappings` it creates these.

    <Ctrl-f>: ~
        Go to the next placeholder in the snippet.

    <Ctrl-b>: ~
        Go to the previous placeholder in the snippet.

    <Tab>: ~
        Enables completion when the cursor is inside a word. If the completion
        menu is visible it will navigate to the next item in the list.

    <Shift-Tab>: ~
        When the completion menu is visible navigate to the previous
        item in the list.

==============================================================================
LSP                                                      *lsp-zero-lsp-config*

Language servers are configured and initialized using |lspconfig|.

lsp-zero adds some extra "capabilities" to lspconfig's defaults, they tell the
language server what features |nvim-cmp| adds to the editor.

Then it creates an autocommand on the event |LspAttach|. This autocommand will
be triggered every time a language server is attached to a buffer. Is where
all keybindings and commands are created.

Finally it calls the .setup() of each language server.

If you were to do it all by yourself, the code would look like this.
>lua
  local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')
  local lsp_defaults = lspconfig.util.default_config

  lsp_defaults.capabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend(
    'force',
    lsp_defaults.capabilities,
    require('cmp_nvim_lsp').default_capabilities()
  )

  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('LspAttach', {
    desc = 'LSP actions',
    callback = function(event)
      vim.keymap.set('n', 'K', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<cr>', {buffer = event.buf})
      -- More keybindings and commands....
    end
  })

  lspconfig.tsserver.setup({})
  lspconfig.eslint.setup({})
<
                                                           *lsp-zero-commands*

LspZeroFormat {server} timeout={timeout}: ~
    Formats the current buffer or range. Under the hood lsp-zero is using the
    function |vim.lsp.buf.format()|.

    If the "bang" is provided formatting will be asynchronous
    (ex: `LspZeroFormat!`).

    If you provide the name of a language server as a first argument it will
    try to format only using that server. Otherwise, it will use every
    active language server with formatting capabilities.

    With the {timeout} parameter you can configure the time in milliseconds
    to wait for the response of the formatting requests.

LspZeroWorkspaceRemove: ~
    Remove the folder at path from the workspace folders.
    See |vim.lsp.buf.remove_workspace_folder()|.

LspZeroWorkspaceAdd: ~
    Add the folder at path to the workspace folders.
    See |vim.lsp.buf.add_workspace_folder()|.

LspZeroWorkspaceList: ~
    List workspace folders. See |vim.lsp.buf.list_workspace_folders()|.

LspZeroSetupServers [{server}]: ~
    It takes a space separated list of servers and configures them.
    It calls the function |lsp-zero.setup_servers()| under the hood.
    If the `bang` is provided the root dir of the language server
    will be the same as neovim. Note that this command for when you
    decide to handle the configuration of servers manually, it will
    only do something when `setup_servers_on_start` is disabled.

                                                        *lsp-zero-keybindings*

When a language server gets attached to a buffer you gain access to some
keybindings and commands. All of these are bound to a built-in function
so you can get more details using the `:help` command.

K: ~
    Displays hover information about the symbol under the cursor in a
    floating window. See |vim.lsp.buf.hover()|.

gd: ~
    Jumps to the definition of the symbol under the cursor.
    See |vim.lsp.buf.definition()|.

gD: ~
    Jumps to the declaration of the symbol under the cursor. Some servers
    don't implement this feature. See |vim.lsp.buf.declaration()|.

gi: ~
    Lists all the implementations for the symbol under the cursor in the
    quickfix window. See |vim.lsp.buf.implementation()|.

go: ~
    Jumps to the definition of the type of the symbol under the cursor.
    See |vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()|.

gr: ~
    Lists all the references to the symbol under the cursor in the quickfix
    window. See |vim.lsp.buf.references()|.

gs: ~
    Displays signature information about the symbol under the cursor in a
    floating window. See |vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()|. If a mapping
    already exists for this key this function is not bound.

<F2>: ~
    Renames all references to the symbol under the cursor.
    See |vim.lsp.buf.rename()|.

<F3>: ~
    Format a buffer using the LSP servers attached to it.
    See |vim.lsp.buf.format()|.

<F4>: ~
    Selects a code action available at the current cursor position.
    See |vim.lsp.buf.code_action()|.

gl: ~
    Show diagnostic in a floating window. See |vim.diagnostic.open_float()|.

[d: ~
    Move to the previous diagnostic in the current buffer.
    See |vim.diagnostic.goto_prev()|.

]d: ~
    Move to the next diagnostic. See |vim.diagnostic.goto_next()|.

==============================================================================
Server Installer                                          *lsp-zero-installer*

Install and updates of language servers is done with |mason.nvim|.

To install a server manually use the command `LspInstall` with the name of the
server you want to install. If you don't provide a name the command will try
to suggest a language server based on the filetype of the current buffer.

To check for updates on the language servers use the command `Mason`.
A floating window will open showing you all the packages mason.nvim can
install. You can filter the packages by categories for example, language
servers are in the second category, so if you press the number `2` it'll
show only the language servers. The packages you have installed will appear
at the top. If there is any update available, the item will display a message.
Navigate to that item and press u to install the update.

To uninstall a server use the command Mason. Navigate to the language server
you want to delete and press X.

To know more about the available bindings inside the floating window of
`Mason` press `g?`.

If you need to customize `mason.nvim` make sure you do it before
calling the `lsp-zero` module.
>lua
  require('mason.settings').set({
    ui = {
      border = 'rounded'
    }
  })

  local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset({})

  lsp.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
    lsp.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
  end)

  lsp.setup()
<
Opt-out of mason.nvim                             *lsp-zero-installer-opt-out*

Really all you need is to uninstall |mason.nvim| and |mason-lspconfig.nvim|.
But the correct way to opt-out if you are using the `recommended` preset
is to change it to `system-lsp`. Or use these settings:
>lua
  setup_servers_on_start = false
  call_servers = 'global'
<
Then you need to specify which language server you want to setup, for this
use |lsp-zero.setup_servers()| or |lsp-zero.configure()|.

==============================================================================
Migrating away from lsp-zero                           *lsp-zero-migrate-away*

There is a good chance the only thing you want from lsp-zero is the automatic
setup of LSP servers. Let me tell you how to configure that.

You'll need these plugins:

* https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim
* https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim
* https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig
* https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp

You need to configure them in this order.
>lua
  require('mason').setup()

  require('mason-lspconfig').setup({
    ensure_installed = {
      -- Replace these with whatever servers you want to install
      'rust_analyzer',
      'tsserver',
    }
  })

  local lsp_capabilities = require('cmp_nvim_lsp').default_capabilities()
  local lsp_attach = function(client, bufnr)
    -- Create your keybindings here...
  end

  local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')
  require('mason-lspconfig').setup_handlers({
    function(server_name)
      lspconfig[server_name].setup({
        on_attach = lsp_attach,
        capabilities = lsp_capabilities,
      })
    end,
  })
<
In this example I have automatic install of servers using the option
`ensure_installed` in `mason-lspconfig`. You can delete that list of servers
and add your own.

If you notice your LSP servers don't behave correctly, it might be because
`.setup_handlers`. You can replace that function with a `for` loop.
>lua
  local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')
  local get_servers = require('mason-lspconfig').get_installed_servers

  for _, server_name in ipairs(get_servers()) do
    lspconfig[server_name].setup({
      on_attach = lsp_attach,
      capabilities = lsp_capabilities,
    })
  end
<

build_options({server}, {opts}): ~
    Returns all the parameters necessary to start a language using
    lspconfig's setup function. After calling this function
    you'll need to initialize the language server by other means.

    The {opts} table will be merged with the rest of the default
    options for {server}.

                                                     *lsp-zero.store_config()*

store_config({name}, {opts}): ~
    Saves the configuration options for a language server, so you can
    use it at a later time in a local config file.

                                                              *lsp-zero.use()*

use({name}, {opts}): ~
    For when you want full control of the servers you want to use in a
    particular project. It is meant to be called in project local config.

    Ideally, you would setup some default values for your servers
    in your neovim config using |lsp-zero.configure()|.
>lua
    -- init.lua

    local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset({})

    lsp.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
      lsp.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
    end)

    lsp.configure('pyright', {
      single_file_support = false,
    })

    lsp.setup()

    And then in your local config you can tweak the server options even more.
>lua
    -- local config

    local lsp = require('lsp-zero')

      }
    })
<
    Options from |lsp-zero.store_config()| will be merged with the ones on
    |lsp-zero.use()| and the server will be initialized.

    Note: lsp-zero does not execute files. It only provides utility functions.
    So to execute your "local config" you'll have to use another plugin.

nvim_lua_ls({opts}): ~
    Returns settings specific to Neovim for the lua language server, lua_ls.
    If you provide the {opts} table it'll merge it with the defaults,
    this way you can extend or change the values easily.

format_on_save({opts}): ~
    Setup autoformat on save. This will to allow you to associate a language
    server with a list of filetypes.

    Keep in mind it's only meant to allow one LSP server per filetype,
    this is so the formatting is consistent.

    `{opts}` supports the following properties:

        * servers: (Table) Key/value pair list. On the left hand side you must
        specify the name of a language server. On the right hand side you must
        provide a list of filetypes, this can be any pattern supported
        by the |FileType| autocommand.

        * format_opts: (Table). These are the same options you can pass to
        |vim.lsp.buf.format()|.

    When you enable async formatting the only arguments in `format_opts` that
    will have any effect are `formatting_options` and `timeout_ms`, the rest
    will be ignored.

buffer_autoformat({client}, {bufnr}, {opts}): ~
    Format the current buffer using the active language servers.

    If {client} argument is provided it will only use the LSP server
    associated with that client.

        * {client} (Table, Optional) if provided it must be a lua table
        with a `name` property or an instance of |vim.lsp.client|.

        * {bufnr} (Number, Optional) if provided it must be the id
        of an open buffer.

        * {opts}: (Table). These are the same options you can pass to
        |vim.lsp.buf.format()|.

async_autoformat({client}, {bufnr}, {opts}): ~
    Send a formatting request to {client}. After the getting the response
    from the client it will save the file (again).

    Here is how it works: when you save the file Neovim will write your
    changes without formatting. Then, lsp-zero will send a request to
    {client}, when it gets the response it will apply the formatting and
    save the file again.

      * client: (Table) It must be an instance of |vim.lsp.client|.

      * bufnr: (Number, Optional) if provided it must be the id of an open
      buffer.

      * opts: (Table, Optional). Supports the following properties: 

        * formatting_options: Settings send to the language server. These
        are the same settings as the `formatting_options` argument in
        |vim.lsp.buf.format()|.

        * timeout_ms: (Number, Optional) Defaults to 10000. Time in
        milliseconds to ignore the current format request.

    Do not use this in the global `on_attach`, call this function
    with the specific language server you want to format with.

    Here is an example.
>lua
    local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset({})

    lsp.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
      lsp.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
    end)

format_mapping({key}, {opts}): ~
    Configure {key} to format the current buffer.   

    The idea here is that you associate a language server with a list of
    filetypes, so {key} can format the buffer using only one LSP server.

    `{opts}` supports the following properties:

        * servers: (Table) Key/value pair list. On the left hand side you must
        specify the name of a language server. On the right hand side you must
        provide a list of filetypes, this can be any pattern supported
        by the |FileType| autocommand.

        * format_opts: (Table). These are the same options you can pass to
        |vim.lsp.buf.format()|.

        * mode: (Table). The list of modes where the keybinding will be active.
        By default is set to `{'n', 'x'}`, which means normal mode and visual
        mode.

            Text for the error signs.

        * warn: ~
            Text for the warning signs.

highlight_symbol({client}, {bufnr}): ~
    Uses the |CursorHold| event to trigger a document highlight request. In
    other words, it will highlight the symbol under the cursor.

    For this to work properly your colorscheme needs to set these highlight
    groups: `LspReferenceRead`, `LspReferenceText` and `LspReferenceWrite`.

    Keep in mind the event `CursorHold` depends on the |'updatetime'| option.
    If you want the highlight to happen fast, you will need to set this option
    to a "low" value.
>lua

new_server({opts}): ~
    lsp-zero will execute a user provided function to detect the root
    directory of the project when Neovim assigns the file type for a
    buffer. If the root directory is detected the LSP server will be
    attached to the file.

    This function does not depend on `lspconfig`, it's a thin wrapper
    around a Neovim function called |vim.lsp.start()|.

    `{opts}` supports every property `vim.lsp.start` supports with
    a few changes:

        * `filestypes`: (Table) Can be list filetype names. This can be
        any pattern the `FileType` autocommand accepts.

        * `root_dir`: Can be a function, it'll be executed after Neovim
        assigns the file type for a buffer. If it returns a string
        that will be considered the root directory for the project.

    Other important properties are:

        * `cmd`: (Table) A lua table with the arguments necessary to start
        the language server.

        * `name`: (String) The name Neovim will assign to the client object.

        * `on_attach`: (Function) A function that will be executed after
        the language server gets attached to a buffer.

    Here is an example that starts the typescript language server on
    javascript and typescript, but only in a project that package.json
    in the current directory or any of its parent folders.

dir.find_first({list}): ~
    Checks the parent directories and returns the path to the first folder
    that has a file in {list}. Useful to detect the root directory.

    Note: search will stop once it gets to your "HOME" folder.

    {list} supports the following properties:

      * path: (String) The path from where it should start looking for
      the files in {list}.

      * buffer: (Boolean) When enabled use the path of the current buffer.

    Note: search will stop once it gets to your "HOME" folder.

    {list} supports the following properties:

cmp_action(): ~
    Returns methods meant to be used as mappings for |nvim-cmp|.

    These are the supported methods:

        tab_complete: ~
            Enables completion when the cursor is inside a word.
            If the completion menu is visible it will navigate
            to the next item in the list. If the line is empty
            it uses the fallback.

        select_prev_or_fallback: ~
            If the completion menu is visible navigate to the
            previous item in the list. Else, uses the fallback.

        toggle_completion: ~
            If the completion menu is visible it cancels the process. Else, it
            triggers the completion menu. You can use the property `modes` in
            the first argument to specify where this mapping should active
            (the default is `{modes = {'i'}}`).

        luasnip_jump_forward: ~
            Go to the next placeholder in the snippet.

        luasnip_jump_backward: ~
            Go to the previous placeholder in the snippet.

        luasnip_next: ~
            If completion menu is visible it will navigate to the item in the
            list. If the cursor can jump to a snippet placeholder, it moves to
            it. Else, it uses the fallback.

        luasnip_next_or_expand: ~
            If completion menu is visible it will navigate to the item in the
            list. If cursor is on top of the trigger of a snippet it'll expand
            it. If the cursor can jump to a snippet placeholder, it moves to
            it. Else, it uses the fallback.

        luasnip_supertab: ~
            If the completion menu is visible it will navigate to the
            next item in the list. If cursor is on top of the trigger
            of a snippet it'll expand it. If the cursor can jump to a
            snippet placeholder, it moves to it. If the cursor is in
            the middle of a word that doesn't trigger a snippet it
            displays the completion menu. Else, it uses the fallback.

        luasnip_shift_supertab: ~
            If the completion menu is visible it'll navigate to previous item
            in the list. If the cursor can navigate to a previous snippet
            placeholder, it moves to it. Else, it uses the fallback.

    Quick note: "the fallback" is the default behavior of the key
    you assign to a method.

                                                       *lsp-zero.extend_cmp()*

extend_cmp({opts}): ~
    In case you don't want to use lsp-zero to actually setup any LSP servers,
    or want to lazy load nvim-cmp, you can use .extend_cmp to setup nvim-cmp.

    When you used it is assumed you want a "minimal" configuration.
    Meaning that if you call it without {opts} it will use the same
    config the minimal preset uses in the setting manage_nvim_cmp.

    {opts} supports the same properties `manage_nvim_cmp` has.

.omnifunc.setup({opts}): ~
    Configure the behavior of Neovim's completion mechanism. If for some
    reason you refuse to install nvim-cmp you can use this function to
    make the built-in completions more user friendly.

    {opts} supports the following properties:

      * autocomplete: (String) Default value is `false`. When enabled it
      triggers the completion menu if the character under the cursor matches
      `opts.keyword_pattern`. Completions will be disabled when you are
      recording a macro. Do note, the implementation here is extremely
      simple, there isn't any kind of optimizations in place. Is literally
      like pressing `<Ctrl-x><Ctrl-o>` after you insert a character in a
      word.
      
      * tabcomplete: (Boolean) Default value is `false`. When enabled `<Tab>`
      will trigger the completion menu if the cursor is in the middle of a
      word. When the completion menu is visible it will navigate to the next
      item in the menu. If there is a blank character under the cursor it
      inserts a `Tab` character. `<Shift-Tab>` will navigate to the previous
      item in the menu, and if the menu is not visible it'll insert a `Tab`
      character.

      * trigger: (String) It must be a valid keyboard shortcut. This will be
      used as a keybinding to trigger the completion menu manually.
      Actually, it will be able to toggle the completion menu. You'll be
      able to show and hide the menu with the same keybinding.

      * use_fallback: (Boolean) Default value is `false`. When enabled
      lsp-zero will try to complete using the words in the current buffer. And
      when an LSP server is attached to the buffer, it will replace the
      fallback completion with the LSP completions.

      * keyword_pattern: (String) Regex pattern used by the autocomplete
      implementation. Default value is `"[[:keyword:]]"`.

      * update_on_delete: (Boolean) Default value is `false`. Turns out Neovim
      will hide the completion menu when you delete a character, so when you
      enable this option lsp-zero will trigger the menu again after you press
      `<backspace>`. This will only happen with LSP completions, the fallback
      completion updates automatically (again, this is Neovim's default
      behavior). This option is disabled by default because it requires
      lsp-zero to bind the backspace key, which may cause conflicts with other
      plugins.

      * select_behavior: (String) Default value is `"select"`. Configures what
      happens when you select an item in the completion menu. When the value
      is `"insert"` Neovim will insert the text of the item in the buffer.
      When the value is `"select"` nothing happens, Neovim will only highlight
      the item in the menu, the text in the buffer will not change.

      * preselect: (Boolean) Default value is `true`. When enabled the first
      item in the completion menu will be selected automatically.

      * verbose: (Boolean) Default value is `false`. When enabled Neovim will
      show the state of the completion in message area.

      * mapping: (Table) Defaults to an empty table. With this you can
      configure the keybinding for common actions.

          * confirm: Accept the selected completion item.

          * abort: Cancel current completion.

          * next_item: Navigate to next item in the completion menu.

          * prev_item: Navigate to previous item in the completion menu.

    You can configure a basic "tab completion" behavior using these settings.

                                                   *lsp-zero.setup_nvim_cmp()*

setup_nvim_cmp({opts}): ~
    {opts} allows you to override some of `nvim-cmp` defaults:

        completion: ~
            Configures the behavior of the completion menu. You can find
            more details about its properties if you start typing the
            command `:help cmp-config.completion`.

        sources: ~
            List of configurations for "data sources".
            See |cmp-config.sources| to know more.

        documentation: ~
            Modifies the look of the documentation window. You can find
            more details about its properities if you start typing the
            command `:help cmp-config.window`.

        formatting: ~
            Modifies the look of the completion menu. You can find more
            details about its properities if you start typing the
            command `:help cmp-config.formatting`.

        preselect: ~
            By default, the first item in the completion menu is preselected.
            Disable this behaviour by setting this to `cmp.PreselectMode.None`.
            See |cmp-config.preselect| to know more.

        mapping: ~
            Sets the keybindings. See |cmp-mapping|.

        select_behavior: ~
            Configure behavior when selecting items from completion menu.
            It can be set to the values `'insert'` or `'select'`. With the
            value 'select' nothing happens when you move between items. With
            the value 'insert' it'll put the text from the selection in the
            buffer.

            Is worth mention these values are available as "types" in the
            `cmp` module: `require('cmp').SelectBehavior`.

                                                   *lsp-zero.nvim_workspace()*

nvim_workspace({opts}): ~
    Configures the language server for lua with all the options needed
    to provide completions specific to neovim.

    {opts} supports two properties:

        root_dir: ~
            A function that determines the working directory of
            the language server.

        library: ~
            A list of paths that the server should analyze.

            By default only the runtime files of neovim and
            `vim.stdpath('config')` will be included. To add the path to
            every plugin you'll need to do this.
>lua
            lsp.nvim_workspace({
              library = vim.api.nvim_get_runtime_file('', true)
            })
<
                                             *lsp-zero.defaults.diagnostics()*

defaults.diagnostics({opts}): ~
    Returns the configuration for diagnostics. If you provide the {opts}
    table it'll merge it with the defaults, this way you can extend
    or change the values easily.

                                             *lsp-zero.defaults.cmp_sources()*

defaults.cmp_sources(): ~
    Returns the list of "sources" used in nvim-cmp.

                                            *lsp-zero.defaults.cmp_mappings()*

defaults.cmp_mappings({opts}): ~
    Returns a table with the default keybindings for nvim-cmp. If you provide
    the {opts} table it'll merge it with the defaults, this way you can
    extend or change the values easily.

                                              *lsp-zero.defaults.cmp_config()*

defaults.cmp_config({opts}): ~
    Returns the entire configuration table for nvim-cmp. If you provide
    the {opts} table it'll merge it with the defaults, this way you can
    extend or change the values easily.

                                          *lsp-zero.defaults.nvim_workspace()*

defaults.nvim_workspace({opts}): ~
    Returns the neovim specific settings for `lua_ls` language server.

                                                 *lsp-zero.ensure_installed()*

ensure_installed({list}): ~
    Installs all the servers in {list} if they are missing.
>lua
      lsp.ensure_installed({
        'html',
        'cssls',
        'tsserver'
      })
<
                                                 *lsp-zero.extend_lspconfig()*

.extend_lspconfig({opts}): ~
    The purpose of this function is to allow you to interact with lspconfig
    directly and still get some features lsp-zero offers.

    It adds the capabilities provided by cmp_nvim_lsp to the default
    configuration in lspconfig. It also creates an autocommand that
    executes a function everytime a language server is attached
    to a buffer.

    Note: don't use it along side |lsp-zero.setup()|. This function
    is independent of any settings provided by presets.

    This is the intended usage:
>lua
    require('mason').setup()
    require('mason-lspconfig').setup()
    require('lsp-zero').extend_lspconfig()

    require('lspconfig').tsserver.setup({})
<
    Notice here it can coexists with other plugins. Allowing you to have
    full control of your configuration.

    {opts} table supports the following properties:

        set_lsp_keymaps: ~
            It supports the same properties as the preset counter part.

        capabilities: ~
            These are the "client capabilities" a language server expects.
            This argument will be merge nvim-cmp's default capabilities
            if you have it installed.

        on_attach: ~
            This must be a function. Think of it as "global" on_attach
            so you don't have to keep passing a function to each
            server's setup function.

    Here's an example that showcase each option.
>lua
    require('lsp-zero').extend_lspconfig({
      set_lsp_keymaps = {omit = {'<C-k>', 'gl'}},
      on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
        print('hello there')
      end,
      capabilities = {
        textDocument = {
          foldingRange = {
            dynamicRegistration = false,
            lineFoldingOnly = true
          }
        }
      }
    })
