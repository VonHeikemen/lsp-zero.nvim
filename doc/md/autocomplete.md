# Autocompletion

## Introduction

The plugin responsable for autocompletion is [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp). This plugin is designed to be unopinionated and modular. What this means for us (the users) is that we have to assemble various pieces to get a good experience. I hope I can show you everything you need to configure nvim-cmp the way you want.

## Preset settings

You can tweak the behavior of nvim-cmp using a preset. You can control what lsp-zero is going to do with nvim-cmp. The [minimal](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/blob/v2.x/doc/md/api-reference.md#minimal) preset has the following settings:

```lua
manage_nvim_cmp = {
  set_sources = 'lsp',
  set_basic_mappings = true,
  set_extra_mappings = false,
  use_luasnip = true,
  set_format = true,
  documentation_window = true,
}
```

If you want to know the details of each property go to [the api reference](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/blob/v2.x/doc/md/api-reference.md#manage_nvim_cmp). But what this means is you can do stuff like this.

```lua
local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset({
  manage_nvim_cmp = {
    set_sources = 'recommended'
  }
})
```

In this particular example I'm saying that I want to setup all the "recommended" sources for nvim-cmp.

## Recommended sources

In nvim-cmp a "source" is a plugin (a neovim plugin) that provides the actual data displayed in the completion menu. If you set `manage_nvim_cmp.set_sources` to the string `'recommended'`, lsp-zero will try to setup the following sources (if they are installed):

* [cmp-buffer](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-buffer): provides suggestions based on the current file.

* [cmp-path](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-path): gives completions based on the filesystem.

* [cmp_luasnip](https://github.com/saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip): it shows snippets in the suggestions.

* [cmp-nvim-lsp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp): show data send by the language server.

## Keybindings

### Basic mappings

These are the keybindings you get when you enable `manage_nvim_cmp.set_basic_mappings`. They are meant to follow Neovim's default whenever possible.

* `<Ctrl-y>`: Confirms selection.

* `<Ctrl-e>`: Cancel the completion.

* `<Down>`: Navigate to the next item on the list.

* `<Up>`: Navigate to previous item on the list.

* `<Ctrl-n>`: If the completion menu is visible, go to the next item. Else, trigger completion menu.

* `<Ctrl-p>`: If the completion menu is visible, go to the previous item. Else, trigger completion menu.

* `<Ctrl-d>`: Scroll down in the item's documentation.

* `<Ctrl-u>`: Scroll up in the item's documentation.

### Extra mappings

These are the keybindings you get when you enable `manage_nvim_cmp.set_extra_mappings`. These enable tab completion and navigation between snippet placeholders.

* `<Ctrl-f>`: Go to the next placeholder in the snippet.

* `<Ctrl-b>`: Go to the previous placeholder in the snippet.

* `<Tab>`: Enables completion when the cursor is inside a word. If the completion menu is visible it will navigate to the next item in the list.

* `<Shift-Tab>`: When the completion menu is visible navigate to the previous item in the list.

## Customizing nvim-cmp

What I actually recommend is using `cmp` directly. Let lsp-zero do the "minimal" config, then use the module `cmp` any extra feature you want.

Make sure you setup `cmp` after lsp-zero, so you can override every option properly.

```lua
local lsp = require('lsp-zero').preset({})

lsp.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
  lsp.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
end)

lsp.setup()

local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  ---
  -- Add you own config here...
  ---
})
```

### Use Enter to confirm completion

You'll want to add an entry to the `mapping` option of nvim-cmp. You can assign `<CR>` to the function `cmp.mapping.confirm`.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  mapping = {
    ['<CR>'] = cmp.mapping.confirm({select = false}),
  }
})
```

In that example `Enter` will only confirm the selected item. You need to select the item before pressing enter.

If you want to confirm without selecting the item, use this.

```lua
['<CR>'] = cmp.mapping.confirm({select = true}),
```

### Adding a source

Yes, I know I have a thing that configures this for you but at this point it is only there for backwards compatibility with the `v1.x` branch. There is no "intuitive" way to override that config, so advise you do this yourself to gain better control.

This is what the "recommended" configuration for `sources` looks like.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  sources = {
    {name = 'path'},
    {name = 'nvim_lsp'},
    {name = 'buffer', keyword_length = 3},
    {name = 'luasnip', keyword_length = 2},
  }
})
```

Once you have this you can change the priority by changing the order in the list. You can delete sources or you can add more.

### Add an external collection of snippets

It turns out luasnip can load snippets in a couple of popular formats like the VScode format and a snipmate-like format. All you have to do is call the right "loader" and then add the [cmp_luasnip](https://github.com/saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip) to nvim-cmp.

This is how you add support for [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets).

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')
local cmp_action = require('lsp-zero').cmp_action()

require('luasnip.loaders.from_vscode').lazy_load()

cmp.setup({
  sources = {
    {name = 'nvim_lsp'},
    {name = 'luasnip'},
  },
  mapping = {
    ['<C-f>'] = cmp_action.luasnip_jump_forward(),
    ['<C-b>'] = cmp_action.luasnip_jump_backward(),
  }
})
```

If you want to use [honza/vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets), you'll have to call a different loader.

```lua
require('luasnip.loaders.from_snipmate').lazy_load()
```

### Preselect first item

Make the first item in completion menu always be selected.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  preselect = 'item',
  completion = {
    completeopt = 'menu,menuone,noinsert'
  },
})
```

### Basic completions for Neovim's lua api

Add the [cmp-nvim-lua](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lua) source.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  sources = {
    {name = 'nvim_lsp'},
    {name = 'nvim_lua'},
  },
  mapping = {
    ['<C-f>'] = cmp_action.luasnip_jump_forward(),
    ['<C-b>'] = cmp_action.luasnip_jump_backward(),
  }
})
```

### Enable "Super Tab"

If you are the kind of person who likes to do everything with the `Tab` key, try this:

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')
local cmp_action = require('lsp-zero').cmp_action()

cmp.setup({
  mapping = {
    ['<Tab>'] = cmp_action.luasnip_supertab(),
    ['<S-Tab>'] = cmp_action.luasnip_shift_supertab(),
  }
})
```

If the completion menu is visible it will navigate to the next item in the list. If the cursor on the trigger of a snippet it'll expand it. If the cursor can jump to a snippet placeholder, it moves to it. If the cursor is in the middle of a word that doesn't trigger a snippet it displays the completion menu. Else, it acts like a regular `Tab` key.

### Regular tab complete

Trigger the completion menu when the cursor is inside a word. If the completion menu is visible it will navigate to the next item in the list. If the line is empty it uses the fallback.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')
local cmp_action = require('lsp-zero').cmp_action()

cmp.setup({
  mapping = {
    ['<Tab>'] = cmp_action.tab_complete(),
    ['<S-Tab>'] = cmp_action.select_prev_or_fallback(),
  }
})
```

### Invoke completion menu manually

In case you want to trigger the completion menu manually using `Control + Space`.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  completion = {
    autocomplete = false
  },
  mapping = {
    ['<C-Space>'] = cmp.mapping.complete(),
  }
})
```

### Adding borders to completion menu

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  window = {
    completion = cmp.config.window.bordered(),
    documentation = cmp.config.window.bordered(),
  }
})
```

### Change formatting of completion item

Here is a basic example that adds icons based on the name of the source.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  formatting = {
    -- changing the order of fields so the icon is the first
    fields = {'menu', 'abbr', 'kind'},

    -- here is where the change happens
    format = function(entry, item)
      local menu_icon = {
        nvim_lsp = 'Î»',
        luasnip = 'â‹—',
        buffer = 'Î©',
        path = 'ðŸ–«',
        nvim_lua = 'Î ',
      }

      item.menu = menu_icon[entry.source.name]
      return item
    end,
  },
})
```

### lsp-kind

[lspkind.nvim](https://github.com/onsails/lspkind.nvim) should work too.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  formatting = {
    fields = {'abbr', 'kind', 'menu'},
    format = require('lspkind').cmp_format({
      mode = 'symbol', -- show only symbol annotations
      maxwidth = 50, -- prevent the popup from showing more than provided characters
      ellipsis_char = '...', -- when popup menu exceed maxwidth, the truncated part would show ellipsis_char instead
    })
  }
})
```
