# Autocompletion

## Keybindings

These are the keybindings nvim-cmp's preset enables by default. They are meant to follow Neovim's default.

* `<Ctrl-y>`: Confirms selection.

* `<Ctrl-e>`: Cancel the completion.

* `<Down>`: Navigate to the next item on the list.

* `<Up>`: Navigate to previous item on the list.

* `<Ctrl-n>`: Go to the next item in the completion menu, or trigger completion menu.

* `<Ctrl-p>`: Go to the previous item in the completion menu, or trigger completion menu.

## Customizing nvim-cmp

You must use the module `cmp` to add any extra features you want. Like this.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  ---
  -- Add your own config here...
  ---
})
```

## Adding a source

If you don't know, each source that you add to your configuration is a Neovim plugin that you need to install. The purpose of a source is to extract data and then pass it to nvim-cmp.

Let's say we want to use this source [hrsh7th/cmp-buffer](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-buffer). `cmp-buffer` will extract suggestions from the current file. This will allow nvim-cmp to show completions even when we don't have a language server active in the current buffer.

So the first thing we need to do is install the plugin [hrsh7th/cmp-buffer](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-buffer). Use your favorite plugin manager to do it.

Second step, figure out what is the name of the source. I don't mean the name of the plugin, this is different. Go to the github repo [hrsh7th/cmp-buffer](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-buffer) and look for configuration instructions.

Third step, add the sources you want to use to nvim-cmp's config. For this we need to call the setup function of the `cmp` module, add the `sources` options and list every source we have installed.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  sources = {
    {name = 'nvim_lsp'},
    {name = 'buffer'},
  },
})
```

Notice we have two sources. The first source, `{name = 'nvim_lsp'}`, belongs to this plugin [hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp). This is the source recommended in the getting started page.

`{name = 'buffer'}` is the new plugin [hrsh7th/cmp-buffer](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-buffer). After adding this we can restart Neovim and test it.

## Custom mappings

To add your custom keybindings you must use the option `mapping` in nvim-cmp's settings. In this case is important to use nvim-cmp's preset so you don't lose the default keybindings.

Here is an example.

```lua
cmp.setup({
  mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
    -- confirm completion
    ['<C-y>'] = cmp.mapping.confirm({select = true}),

    -- scroll up and down the documentation window
    ['<C-u>'] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(-4),
    ['<C-d>'] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(4),   
  }),
})
```

## Add an external collection of snippets

What most people do in this case is use [luasnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) and [cmp_luasnip](https://github.com/saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip). You must install those two plugins.

`luasnip` will be the snippet engine, the thing that expands the snippets. `cmp_luasnip` is the nvim-cmp source that enables the available snippets into nvim-cmp.

If you are not familiar with the concept of nvim-cmp source, see the previous section ["Adding a source"](#adding-a-source)).

We don't need to write our own snippets, we can download a collection like [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets) and then parse them using a luasnip loader.

Here is the code you would need to load `friendly-snippets` into nvim-cmp.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

require('luasnip.loaders.from_vscode').lazy_load()

cmp.setup({
  sources = {
    {name = 'nvim_lsp'},
    {name = 'luasnip'},
  },
  snippet = {
    expand = function(args)
      require('luasnip').lsp_expand(args.body)
    end,
  },
  mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
    -- Jump to the next snippet placeholder
    ['<C-f>'] = cmp.mapping(function(fallback)
      local luasnip = require('luasnip')
      if luasnip.locally_jumpable(1) then
        luasnip.jump(1)
      else
        fallback()
      end
    end, {'i', 's'}),
    -- Jump to the previous snippet placeholder
    ['<C-b>'] = cmp.mapping(function(fallback)
      local luasnip = require('luasnip')
      if luasnip.locally_jumpable(-1) then
        luasnip.jump(-1)
      else
        fallback()
      end
    end, {'i', 's'}),
  }),
})
```

If you want to use [honza/vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets), you'll have to call a different loader.

```lua
require('luasnip.loaders.from_snipmate').lazy_load()
```

## Use Enter to confirm completion

You'll want to add an entry to the `mapping` option of nvim-cmp. You can assign `<CR>` to the function `cmp.mapping.confirm`.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
    ['<CR>'] = cmp.mapping.confirm({select = false}),
  }),
})
```

In that example `Enter` will only confirm the selected item. You need to select the item before pressing enter.

If you want to confirm without selecting the item, use this.

```lua
['<CR>'] = cmp.mapping.confirm({select = true}),
```

## Preselect first item

Make the first item in completion menu always be selected.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  preselect = 'item',
  completion = {
    completeopt = 'menu,menuone,noinsert'
  },
})
```

## Basic completions for Neovim's lua api

Install and configure the language server for lua: [lua_ls](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server). Then create a file called `.luarc.json` file in Neovim's config folder.

```json
{
  "runtime.version": "LuaJIT",
  "runtime.path": [
    "lua/?.lua",
    "lua/?/init.lua"
  ],
  "diagnostics.globals": ["vim"],
  "workspace.checkThirdParty": false,
  "workspace.library": [
    "$VIMRUNTIME"
  ]
}
```

## Enable "Super Tab"

This feature only works if you use [luasnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) as the snippet engine in nvim-cmp.

If the completion menu is visible it will navigate to the next item in the list. If the cursor is on top of a "snippet trigger" it'll expand it. If the cursor can jump to a snippet placeholder, it moves to it. If the cursor is in the middle of a word it displays the completion menu. Else, it acts like a regular `Tab` key.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  snippet = {
    expand = function(args)
      require('luasnip').lsp_expand(args.body)
    end,
  },
  mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
    -- Super tab
    ['<Tab>'] = cmp.mapping(function(fallback)
      local luasnip = require('luasnip')
      local col = vim.fn.col('.') - 1

      if cmp.visible() then
        cmp.select_next_item({behavior = 'select'})
      elseif luasnip.expand_or_locally_jumpable() then
        luasnip.expand_or_jump()
      elseif col == 0 or vim.fn.getline('.'):sub(col, col):match('%s') then
        fallback()
      else
        cmp.complete()
      end
    end, {'i', 's'}),

    -- Super shift tab
    ['<S-Tab>'] = cmp.mapping(function(fallback)
      local luasnip = require('luasnip')

      if cmp.visible() then
        cmp.select_prev_item({behavior = 'select'})
      elseif luasnip.locally_jumpable(-1) then
        luasnip.jump(-1)
      else
        fallback()
      end
    end, {'i', 's'}),
  }),
})
```

## Regular tab complete

Trigger the completion menu when the cursor is inside a word. If the completion menu is visible it will navigate to the next item in the list. If the line is empty it acts like a regular `Tab` key.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
    -- Simple tab complete
    ['<Tab>'] = cmp.mapping(function(fallback)
      local col = vim.fn.col('.') - 1

      if cmp.visible() then
        cmp.select_next_item({behavior = 'select'})
      elseif col == 0 or vim.fn.getline('.'):sub(col, col):match('%s') then
        fallback()
      else
        cmp.complete()
      end
    end, {'i', 's'}),

    -- Go to previous item
    ['<S-Tab>'] = cmp.mapping.select_prev_item({behavior = 'select'}),
  }),
})
```

## Invoke completion menu manually

For this you'll have to disable the `completion.autocomplete` option in nvim-cmp. Then, setup a keybinding to trigger the completion menu.

Here is an example that uses `Ctrl + Space` to trigger completions.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  completion = {
    autocomplete = false
  },
  mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
    ['<C-Space>'] = cmp.mapping.complete(),
  }),
})
```

## Adding borders to completion menu

Most people just use the preset nvim-cmp offers. You'll need to configure the `window` option. Inside this window property, you can add borders to the completion menu and also the documentation window. Here is the code.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  window = {
    completion = cmp.config.window.bordered(),
    documentation = cmp.config.window.bordered(),
  },
})
```

## Change formatting of completion item

There is an option called `formatting`, that's the one you want. With this option you can change the order of the "elements" inside a completion item, and you can also add a function that changes the text of each element.

Customizing the format requires some knowledge about lua, 'cause you have to implement the behavior you want. Or you can use a plugin like [lsp-kind](#lsp-kind).

Here is a basic example that adds icons based on the name of the source.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  formatting = {
    -- changing the order of fields so the icon is the first
    fields = {'menu', 'abbr', 'kind'},

    -- here is where the change happens
    format = function(entry, item)
      local menu_icon = {
        nvim_lsp = 'Î»',
        luasnip = 'â‹—',
        buffer = 'Î©',
        path = 'ðŸ–«',
        nvim_lua = 'Î ',
      }

      item.menu = menu_icon[entry.source.name]
      return item
    end,
  },
})
```

If you don't want to implement a format function you can use [lspkind.nvim](https://github.com/onsails/lspkind.nvim).

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')

cmp.setup({
  formatting = {
    fields = {'abbr', 'kind', 'menu'},
    format = require('lspkind').cmp_format({
      mode = 'symbol', -- show only symbol annotations
      maxwidth = 50, -- prevent the popup from showing more than provided characters
      ellipsis_char = '...', -- when popup menu exceed maxwidth, the truncated part would show ellipsis_char instead
    })
  },
})
```
