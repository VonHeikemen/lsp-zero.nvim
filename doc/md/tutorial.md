# Tutorial

Here we will learn enough about Neovim to configure lsp-zero version 3. We will create a configuration file called `init.lua`, install a plugin manager, a colorscheme and finally setup lsp-zero.

## Requirements

* Basic knowledge about Neovim: what is `normal mode`, `insert mode`, `command mode` and how to navigate between them.
* Neovim v0.8 or greater
* git

> If you are using Neovim v0.7, the branch `compat-07` is compatible with that Neovim version. See the [tutorial in the compat-07 branch](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/blob/compat-07/doc/md/tutorial.md).

## The Entry Point

To start we will create the file known as `init.lua`. The location of this file depends on your operating system. If you want to know where that is execute this command on your terminal.

```sh
nvim --headless -c 'echo stdpath("config")' -c 'echo ""' -c 'quit'
```

Create that folder and then navigate to it. Use whatever method you know best, use a terminal or a graphical file explorer.

Now create an empty file called `init.lua`.

Once the configuration exists in your system you can access it from the terminal using this command.

```sh
nvim -c 'edit $MYVIMRC'
```

Now let's make sure Neovim is actually loading our file. We will change the colorscheme to a light theme. So, open your `init.lua` and add this line.

```lua
vim.cmd.colorscheme('morning')
```

Open Neovim again and you should notice the light theme. If you get an error it means your Neovim version does not meet the requirements. Visit Neovim's github repository, in the [release section](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) you'll find prebuilt executables for the latest versions.

If you can't upgrade Neovim you can still install `v1.0` of lsp-zero, I have another tutorial for that:

* [Getting started with neovim's native LSP client](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/blob/v1.x/doc/md/tutorial.md)

Assuming everything went well, you can now change the theme to something else.

```lua
vim.cmd.colorscheme('habamax')
```

## Install the Plugin Manager

> Note: We don't **need** a plugin manager but they make our lives easier.

We are going to use [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), only because that's what the cool kids are doing these days. You can do a lot with lazy.nvim but I'm just going to show the most basic usage.

First step is to install it from github. It just so happens we can do this using lua. In lazy.nvim's documentation they show us how to do it.

Add this to your init.lua.

```lua
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath('data') .. '/lazy/lazy.nvim'
local uv = vim.uv or vim.loop

-- Auto-install lazy.nvim if not present
if not uv.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  print('Installing lazy.nvim....')
  vim.fn.system({
    'git',
    'clone',
    '--filter=blob:none',
    'https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git',
    '--branch=stable', -- latest stable release
    lazypath,
  })
  print('Done.')
end

vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)
```

Notice in `lazypath` we use `stdpath('data')`, this will return the path to Neovim's data folder. So now we don't need to worry about changing our paths depending on the operating system, Neovim will do that for us. If you want to inspect the path, use this command inside Neovim.

```vim
:echo stdpath('data') . '/lazy/lazy.nvim'
```

To actually use lazy.nvim we need to call the `.setup()` function of the lua module called `lazy`. Like this.

```lua
require('lazy').setup({
  ---
  -- List of plugins...
  ---
})
```

## Adding a new plugin

Now let's use lazy.nvim for real this time. We are going to test it with a plugin called [tokyonight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), this is a colorscheme that will make Neovim look pretty.

Ready? We are going to follow these steps.

1. Add the plugin in lazy's setup.

```lua
require('lazy').setup({
  {'folke/tokyonight.nvim'},
})
```

2. We need to delete the old colorscheme line if it's still there.

3. Call the new colorscheme at the end of the `init.lua` file.

```lua
vim.opt.termguicolors = true
vim.cmd.colorscheme('tokyonight')
```

4. Save the file.

5. Restart Neovim.

When Neovim starts it should show a message telling us is cloning the plugin manager. After it's done another window will show up, it'll tell us the progress of the plugin's download. After the plugins are installed they will be loaded.

### Learning more about lazy.nvim

If you want to know more details about lazy.nvim, here are a few resources
(that you can read later). 

* [Lazy.nvim: plugin configuration](https://dev.to/vonheikemen/lazynvim-plugin-configuration-3opi). This will teach you the basics of the "plugin spec" and how to split your plugin setup into multiple files.

* [Lazy.nvim: how to revert a plugin back to a previous version](https://dev.to/vonheikemen/lazynvim-how-to-revert-a-plugin-back-to-a-previous-version-1pdp). Learn how to recover from a bad plugin update.


## Setup lsp-zero

Now we need to add lsp-zero and all its dependencies in lazy's list of plugins.

```lua
require('lazy').setup({
  {'folke/tokyonight.nvim'},
  -- LSP Support
  {
    'VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim',
    branch = 'v3.x',
    lazy = true,
    config = false,
  },
  {
    'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
    dependencies = {
      {'hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp'},
    }
  },
  -- Autocompletion
  {
    'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp',
    dependencies = {
      {'L3MON4D3/LuaSnip'}
    },
  },
})
```

Then we add the configuration at the end of the file.

```lua
local lsp_zero = require('lsp-zero')

lsp_zero.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
  -- see :help lsp-zero-keybindings
  -- to learn the available actions
  lsp_zero.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
end)
```

Save the file, restart Neovim and wait for everything to be downloaded.

Right now this setup won't do much. We don't have any language server installed just yet (and the code to use them is not there yet).

### Language servers and how to use them

First thing you would want to do is install a language server. There are two ways you can do this:

#### Manual global install

In [nvim-lspconfig's documentation](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) you will find the list of LSP servers currently supported. Some of them have install instructions you can follow, others will have a link to the repository of the LSP server.

Let's pretend that we installed `tsserver` and `rust_analyzer`, this is how we would use them.

```lua
local lsp_zero = require('lsp-zero')

lsp_zero.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
  -- see :help lsp-zero-keybindings
  -- to learn the available actions
  lsp_zero.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
end)

require('lspconfig').tsserver.setup({})
require('lspconfig').rust_analyzer.setup({})
```

We use the module `lspconfig` and call the setup function of each language server we installed.

If you need to customize a language server, add your config inside the curly braces of the setup function. Here is an example.

```lua
require('lspconfig').tsserver.setup({
  single_file_support = false,
  on_init = function(client)
    -- disable formatting capabilities
    client.server_capabilities.documentFormattingProvider = false
    client.server_capabilities.documentFormattingRangeProvider = false
  end,
})
```

Now, if none of your language server need a special config you can use the function [.setup_servers](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/blob/v3.x/doc/md/api-reference.md#setup_serverslist-opts).

```lua
local lsp_zero = require('lsp-zero')

lsp_zero.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
  -- see :help lsp-zero-keybindings
  -- to learn the available actions
  lsp_zero.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
end)

lsp_zero.setup_servers({'tsserver', 'rust_analyzer'})
```

#### Local installation with mason.nvim

There is a plugin called [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim), is often described a portable package manager. This plugin will allow Neovim to download language servers (and other type of tools) into a particular folder, meaning that the servers you install using this method will not be available system-wide.

If you decide to use this plugin you'll need some extra tools installed in your system. So, take a look at [mason.nvim's requirements](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim#requirements).

> Note: mason.nvim doesn't provide any "special integration" to the tools it downloads. It's only good for installing and updating tools.

Anyway, if you choose this method you will need to add these two plugins:

* `williamboman/mason.nvim`
* `williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim`

```lua
require('lazy').setup({
  {'folke/tokyonight.nvim'},
  {'williamboman/mason.nvim'},
  {'williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim'},
  -- LSP Support
  {
    'VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim',
    branch = 'v3.x',
    lazy = true,
    config = false,
  },
  {
    'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
    dependencies = {
      {'hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp'},
    }
  },
  -- Autocompletion
  {
    'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp',
    dependencies = {
      {'L3MON4D3/LuaSnip'}
    },
  },
})
```

`mason.nvim` will make sure we have access to the LSP servers. And we will use `mason-lspconfig` to configure the automatic setup of every language server we install.

```lua
local lsp_zero = require('lsp-zero')

lsp_zero.on_attach(function(client, bufnr)
  -- see :help lsp-zero-keybindings
  -- to learn the available actions
  lsp_zero.default_keymaps({buffer = bufnr})
end)

--- if you want to know more about lsp-zero and mason.nvim
--- read this: https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/blob/v3.x/doc/md/guides/integrate-with-mason-nvim.md
require('mason').setup({})
require('mason-lspconfig').setup({
  handlers = {
    lsp_zero.default_setup,
  },
})
```

Now you will have access to a command called `:LspInstall`. If you execute that command while you have a file opened `mason-lspconfig.nvim` will suggest a language server compatible with that type of file.

Note that after you install a language server you need to restart Neovim so it can be configured properly.

#### Root directory

This is a very important concept you need to keep in mind. The "root directory" is the path where your code is. Think of it as your project folder. When you open a file compatible with a language server `lspconfig` will search for a set of files in the current folder (your working directory) or any of the parent folders. If it finds them, the language server will start analyzing that folder.

Some language servers have "single file support" enabled, this means if `lspconfig` can't determine the root directory then the current working directory becomes your root directory.

Let's say you have `lua_ls` installed, if you want it to detect the root directory of your Neovim config you can create a file called `.luarc.json` in the same folder your `init.lua` is located.

#### Configure lua language server

If you installed the language server for lua you are probably getting a lots of warnings, most of them should be about the global variable `vim`. That is a Neovim specific variable, the lua language server doesn't know anything about it. There are a couple of ways we can fix this.

* Workspace specific config

We can add the following config to the `.luarc.json` file located in our Neovim config folder.

```json
{
  "runtime.version": "LuaJIT",
  "runtime.path": [
    "lua/?.lua",
    "lua/?/init.lua"
  ],
  "diagnostics.globals": ["vim"],
  "workspace.checkThirdParty": false,
  "workspace.library": [
    "$VIMRUNTIME",
    "./lua"
  ]
}
```

* Fixed config

You should only use this method if your Neovim config is the only lua project you will ever manage with `lua_ls`.

lsp-zero has a function that returns a basic config for `lua_ls`, this is how you use it.

```lua
local lsp_zero = require('lsp-zero')

local lua_opts = lsp_zero.nvim_lua_ls()
require('lspconfig').lua_ls.setup(lua_opts)
```

If you need to add your own config, use the first argument to `.nvim_lua_ls()`.

```lua
local lsp_zero = require('lsp-zero')

local lua_opts = lsp_zero.nvim_lua_ls({
  single_file_support = false,
  on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
    print('hello world')
  end,
})

require('lspconfig').lua_ls.setup(lua_opts)
```

## Customizing the autocompletion menu

Last thing we are going to do is add some keybindings to the autocomplete menu. lsp-zero already has some defaults in place but they all meant to emulate Neovim's default, so I will suggest a few keybindings that you can add to your config.

Before we start you need to know two things:

1. To customize nvim-cmp you need to use the lua module called `cmp`.
2. To make sure we don't lose the default keybindings we need to use nvim-cmp's preset. That is a function called `.mapping.preset.insert()`.

Here are some common keybindings you might want to add.

```lua
local cmp = require('cmp')
local cmp_action = require('lsp-zero').cmp_action()

cmp.setup({
  mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({
    -- `Enter` key to confirm completion
    ['<CR>'] = cmp.mapping.confirm({select = false}),

    -- Ctrl+Space to trigger completion menu
    ['<C-Space>'] = cmp.mapping.complete(),

    -- Navigate between snippet placeholder
    ['<C-f>'] = cmp_action.luasnip_jump_forward(),
    ['<C-b>'] = cmp_action.luasnip_jump_backward(),

    -- Scroll up and down in the completion documentation
    ['<C-u>'] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(-4),
    ['<C-d>'] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(4),
  })
})
```

Note that here I'm showing a function called [.cmp_action()](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/blob/v3.x/doc/md/api-reference.md#cmp_action), other extra mappings that people requested. There is a function for tab complete, one for a "supertab" behavior and a few others.
